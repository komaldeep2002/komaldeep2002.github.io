- WHAT IS REACT
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It creates reusable UI components.

- Why i chose this
First of all it is a very demanding and popular language and as for our capstone we are using this so that is one of the main reasons for me to choose this.
Secondly, React's declarative syntax allows developers to describe the desired state of their UI without worrying about the underlying implementation details.
And React components can be easily reused across different parts of an application, which can save time and improve code maintainability.

-Getting started with React
To get started with React, you'll need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll also need to have Node.js installed on your computer.
Once you have Node.js installed, you can create a new React project using the create-react-app command. Here's an example:

+ npx create-react-app my-app
+cd my-app
+npm start
